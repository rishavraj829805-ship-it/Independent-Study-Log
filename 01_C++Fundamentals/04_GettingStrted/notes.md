# Logic errors

* errors or bugs in your code that causes your program to run incorrectly or not as expected

* logic errors are mistake made by programmers

if(age > 18){
    std::cout << "Yes, you can vote!!" << endl;
}
* this is an example of logic error as voting right is also for exact 18 year old person too but according to our 
 program it's for only who are above 18 not exactly 18 ones
